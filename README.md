Hey! I'm **fig** (he/him). I'm a 20-year old programmer, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/) in West Lafayette, Indiana.

## About Me
- While I specialize in C and C++, I've been coding for most of my life and can write in most popular languages.
- I love reverse-engineering and modding games, and most of my projects reflect that.
- Music plays a huge part in my life. I've been playing musical instruments since I was 5, and I currently play the Trombone in the Purdue Wind Ensemble.
- I enjoy spending each of my summers doing Drum Corps, specifically with the [Boston Crusaders](https://bostoncrusaders.org/). If you've never heard of the activity, there's a pretty good summary by the New York Times [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/21/style/bluecoat-drum-corps-championship.html).
- I really enjoy teaching, and I'm currently employed as a Marching Band Instructor at a local high school
