### Hi there 👋
I'm **fig**! I'm a 17-year old programmer! I am currently a senior in High School, and I intend on double-majoring in Computer Science and Music Education as I transition into college.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on college applications, which takes quite a bit of time
- 🎺 I'm a trombone player, currently working on Arban's Carnival of Venice to improve my technique
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
